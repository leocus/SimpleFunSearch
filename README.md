# Re-implementation of FunSearch
This repository contains a simple, single-population re-implementation of FunSearch.

It requires an endpoint (e.g., llama.cpp server) to query for completing the steps.

New problems can be added to `./evaluators.py`, and the hyperparameters can be set in the `./config.yaml` file.
